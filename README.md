# Robotron
A Java based clone of a classic game Robotron with a procedurally generated world with a steeply increasing difficulty curve and A* search based AI designed in Processing.

Compile Instructions:

Controls:
Arrow keys or wasd(with caps lock OFF) can be used to move around horizontally or vertically.
The mouse can be moved around to aim and clicked to shoot bullets.

Aim:
The aim of each wave is to kill the robots to pass the wave, but since there are endless waves, the
game can be played to achieve a high score which can be done by rescuing more members of the
last human family.

Progression:
The waves get more and more complex as the game progresses with boss battles every 5 rounds.

You lose when you run out of lives, you start out with 3 lives and get an extra one for every 500
points scored.
We lose lives when we come in contact with robots or obstacles.
